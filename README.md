**Topic of course project: Banking System**

**Projectâ€™s idea:**
    The main idea of my project is that customers can login through the secured web
    page by their account login id and password. Users will have all options and features in
    that application like get money from western union, money transfer to others, make
    payments for electricity bills, mobile prepaid recharges, mobile bills, water bills etc, and
    send cash or money to inter banking as well as other banking customers by simply adding
    them as payees.

**Project Introduction**
    I am going to use database to store all the details of customer account in a table.
    User can login, do withdrawal, Request a Deposit amount, Transfer amount from one
    account to another account, check his/her current balance, and view reports of all the
    transaction.

**Purpose:**
    The Banking System suite provides a global accounting foundation that provides the all
    private banks with electronic banking facilities. It allows client of private banks to carry
    out their day to day banking transactions.
